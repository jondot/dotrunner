dotrunner
=========

Use ```dotrunner`` <https://github.com/jondot/dotrunner>`__ and
```dotlinker`` <https://github.com/jondot/dotlinker>`__ to build a
fantastically aesthetic macOS dotfiles set up.

| ✅ Organize by topics (folder modules), i.e. ‘nodejs’, ‘osx’, and
  ‘python’.
| ✅ DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) based runner for a powerful dependency
  system.
| ✅ No shell scripts, gunk, yuck, and hairballs required

Here’s an example dotfiles repo:

::

   ~/.dotfiles
       asdf/
       brew/
         install.yml
         Brewfile
       python/
       osx/
       nodejs/
         .npmrc.symlink
         install.yml
       fonts/

And here’s an example ``install.yml`` taken from the ``nodejs`` module:

.. code:: yaml

   script: npm i -g yarn
   deps:
   - asdf

Quick Start
-----------

Note: check out the `example <example/>`__ if you’d like to test this
all out on a Docker container instance.

Install:

::

   $ pip install dotrunner dotlinker

Dry run:

::

   $ dotrunner ~/.dotfiles --dry-run

And finally, apply (this will obviously change your system!):

::

   $ dotrunner ~/.dotfiles

Building a Dotfiles System with dotrunner
-----------------------------------------

This layout describes a system that installs apps (with ``homebrew``),
development tools (with ``asdf``), nodejs tools (with ``install.sh``)
and some system defaults (with ``set-defaults.sh``):

::

   asdf/         <----- a 'module'
     install.yml <----- a module install file. required.
     Asdffile
   brew/
     install.yml
     Brewfile
   nodejs/
     .npmrc.symlink   <--- this is handled by dotlinker, see
                           https://github.com/jondot/dotlinker
     install.yml
     install.sh
   osx/
     install.yml
     set-defaults.sh

This system follows a few simple principles:

-  Every directory is a *module* if it has an ``install.yml`` file and
   it doesn’t start with a dash (-).
-  Each module can describe ``deps`` (dependencies) and a ``script`` to
   run.
-  Each module actions must be idempotent: running the same script
   multiple times will have the same result. In other words
   ``dotrunner`` will happily run your scripts again on reruns/failures
   and you’re responsible to do validation/checks in your scripts.

Here are a few examples of an ``install.yml`` file:

No dependencies:

.. code:: yaml

   script: sh ./install.sh

Has depdendencies but no ``script``, it will use ``./install`` script by
default.

.. code:: yaml

   deps:
   - brew
   - osx

Has both dependencies and a ``script`` which points to an executable
script:

.. code:: yaml

   script: ./install.sh
   deps:
   - brew
   - osx
